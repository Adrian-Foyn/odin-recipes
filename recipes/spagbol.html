        What goes in Spaghetti Bolognese
        I’ve been loyal to this Meat Sauce recipe since I first learned to cook when I was a teenager. There are 3
        little things in this recipe that might be a bit different to Bolognese recipes you’ve seen around:

        1. Worcestershire sauce: it just adds that little extra something-something. I get antsy if I get caught in a
        situation where I have to do without;

        2. Beef bouillon cubes (beef stock cubes) for extra depth of flavour in the sauce, to compensate for this being
        an everyday midweek version rather than a traditional slow cooked Bolognese Ragu which starts with a soffrito
        (onion, celery, carrot slowly sautéed) as well as pancetta.

        3. Sugar, if needed: just a little bit goes a long way to transform the sauce if you happen not to be using high
        quality, sweet Italian canned tomatoes. Supermarket canned tomatoes here in Australia are notoriously sour.
        Especially the Australian ones – it pains me so much to say that, but it’s true.
